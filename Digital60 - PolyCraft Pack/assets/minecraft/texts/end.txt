§3I see the player you mean.

§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.

§2That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.

§3I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.

§2It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.

§3Wait it is?
§2Yes

§3Oh, uhhhh, hello PLAYERNAME.
§2Now, don't think of anything stupid, if you do, the player will know.

§3If I pooped in a toilet, and if the poop goes into the sewers, what if by some chance, the poop lands on a cockroach, and the cockroach flies out of the toilet?

§2Why out of all things would you think of that.

§3Idk

§2Whatever

§3So, this texture pack is for a server called Polycraft, right?

§2Yes

§3You do realise the ender dragon is already dead and the fact that you can just do /warp end?
§2Well that sucks

§3Anyways, im going to poop.

§2Good, he's gone.


§2Ever tried dungeons?

§2Kill Therus, he's stupid.

§2I'm running out of time so im gonna go, bye.

§3You seriously think this is the end?





§3You're a fool, a fool who thinks everything is just a fine perfect world

§3I hate you, you killed my creations, and if you think this is the end, think again.
