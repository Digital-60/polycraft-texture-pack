all good things must come to an end

with the ending of polycraft on 25th November 2023, this pack will have lost almost all use
inevitable but it was nice to finally move on from polycraft, since its activity dropped once everyone had their own lives to go about
it feels as if this pack is like a book which has been put into a shelf, collecting dust with someone looking at it once in a while to reminisce about the past
and honestly, its better that way

as the server ends, so would the times of many, this server really helped me get out of tight spots during some times (i believe i once admitted my self-harm tendencies to the people here, it was nice to know i wasnt alone in the same situation)
the amount of times we said #scuffed when the admins screwed something up
or whether there was a large amount of complaints due to a badly balanecd item
sometimes even just our internet screwing us over and getting us killed
happiness, anger, sadness, serenity, all in one spot

by the time the server ends, some might just leave the polytopia community entirely since they arent interested in it at all
lost after the years spent looking at pixels made of smaller pixels on a screen
which is natural of course

when the server closes, remember the small little shenanigans that happened on your time here
keep those memories, and remember to breathe
